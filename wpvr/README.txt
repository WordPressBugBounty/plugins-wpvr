<h4>üëâ Optimize For Inquiries & Bookings</h4>

<h4>üëâ Make The Visitor Feel Welcomed</h4>
Place a mini-welcome video and add soothing background music to make the visitor feel optimistic and valued right from the start.

<em>All-in-all, offer an experience your prospects won't forget.</em>

<h3>üåü Create A Free Virtual Tour In Just Easy 3 Steps üåü</h3>

WPVR makes virtual tour creation super easy.

All you need are multiple 360 panorama images to cover different rooms, corners, or spots.

Then, you may follow these **3 simple steps** to create a free 360 VR tour in no time;

1. Upload the images to WPVR and they will turn into 360 panoramic views.
1. Connect them to each other for navigation easily.
1. Place hotspots to provide information around your location.

And you are ready. Now you can publish it and place it on any page on your website.

That‚Äôs it, you‚Äôve just created a virtual tour, that too, absolutely free!

Your viewers can move inside or back and forth in this virtual tour, get extra information through hotspots, and get an experience similar to a real-life visit.

*In the free version, you can connect up to 5 scenes, and place up to 5 hotspots on each scene.*

> For unlimited scenes and hotspots, you consider using [WPVR Pro üíé](https://rextheme.com/wpvr/?utm_source=repo-CTA&utm_medium=VR-repo&utm_campaign=VR-repo-to-pricing)

https://youtu.be/kOCNHJdM0TA?si=jdph5JflvX1QmH3S

*You can also add [Scene Transitions (PRO)](https://youtu.be/1VfbztgNFrM?si=e8XfDLDEmrwvYbRn) to make the journey more exciting.*


<h3> Everything You Need To Create Virtual Tours That Engage & Convert </h3>

WPVR is a unique VR tour creator that comes with several exclusive features to make virtual tours more engaging and conversion-optimized.

Simply put, it's not just a tool to show off, but also a solution to **help you get real clients** interested to make inquiries, place bookings, and contact you for negotiations.

<h4>üîÆ High Quality Virtual Tours With Multiple Scenes üîÆ</h4>

Suppose you want to highlight a property with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and maybe 2 balconies. Maybe it has a backyard as well.

No problem. Simply take 360 panoromic images of each of the spaces and use WPVR to combine them into a single virtual tour, where people can view all of them.

But, one of the main concerns you probably have is quality. If you want it to be realistic, it has to be of high quality.

*In WordPress, large images are automatically compressed, reducing panorama image quality. A good 360 panorama image usually comes with a very high resolution that can easily go over 3000√ó1500 pixels.*

But don't worry, WPVR comes with the free option to disable this.

**You can use any high-quality panorama images (JPEG, PNG, WebP) to make your own free 360 VR tours without compromising quality.**

<h4>üîÆ Use Interactive Hotspots To Answer Questions & Engage With Prospects üîÆ</h4>

During a real visit, you would expect people to ask questions, take a closer look at interesting stuff, and get additional facts from you.

Well, why not offer something similar within the tour? ü§î

Simply use interactive hotspots or pointers where you will have full control through *[HTML Editor/WYSIWYG Editor](https://rextheme.com/docs/wysiwyg-html-editor-hotspot-content-virtual-tour/)* to place any type of content for the hotspot.

https://youtu.be/rOAX7gqT7HQ?feature=shared

You can do the following:
<h5>**‚û§ Add Tooltips**</h5>
Add quick information or instructions to view when hovered by visitors.

<h5>**‚û§ Descriptions**</h5>
Let people click to view additional descriptions on an object or a section for better understand.

For example, you can add description for the bed in a hotel room to describe the quality and comfort, exactly what people need to decide.

<h5>**‚û§ Images or gifs**</h5>
If a certain area is unclear, let people click to view clear images or gifs.

<h5>**‚û§ Videos**</h5>
Instead of text, you can place a pre-recorded video to explain it yourself.

<h5>**‚û§ Audio**</h5>
Rather than the rest, when clicked on, play a pre-recorded audio to explain it like a human.

> **Pro Tip:** Think about all the possible questions, concerns, or advantages you could offer as a direct guide. Deliver them on the tour using hotspots.

Other than these, you can even place buttons to load forms or add a link to an external page to maybe take people to an inquiry form or booking form.

*We do have direct support for booking.*

https://youtu.be/ZJkMsq522A4?si=d7dIPGTOj0zINkAb

**Bonus:** You‚Äôll get access to 900+ custom icons to use as hotspots to make the experience meaningufl. And you can add custom colors (Pro) or ripple animation (Pro) to grab user attention.

*P.S. If you want, you can also add custom icons of your own using snippets. ([Hear's how.](https://rextheme.com/docs/how-to-use-the-custom-icon-class/))*

<h4>üîÆ Place Virtual Tours Anywhere On Your Website Naturally, No Complications üîÆ</h4>

Once you have a virtual tour ready, you can use it's [shortcode](https://rextheme.com/docs/wp-vr-wpvr-shortcode-embed-virtual-tour/) to place the virtual tour on any page, no matter what theme you use.

And, to make it easier, we have made it compatible with popular page builder through dedicated blocks/widgets.

- 360 degree view & [Virtual Tour Widget for Elementor](https://rextheme.com/docs/wp-vr-embed-virtual-tour-elementor-widget/).
- 360 Image Viewer & [Virtual Tour Block for Gutenberg](https://rextheme.com/docs/wp-vr-embed-virtual-tour-gutenberg-block/).
- Virtual Tour & [360 VR Panorama Module for Divi](https://rextheme.com/docs/publish-virtual-tour-divi-panorama-module/).
- Panoramic image 360 view & [Virtual Tour Element for Oxygen](https://rextheme.com/docs/wp-vr-oxygen-element-embed-virtual-tour/).
- 360 Panorama Viewer & [Virtual Tour Element for Visual Composer](https://rextheme.com/docs/wp-vr-embed-virtual-tour-visual-composer-element/).

You will have additional control to set custom height, width, and radius, or set it to full-width mode, or full-screen mode by default.

**You can also Publish Virtual Tours with [Password Protection](https://rextheme.com/docs/how-to-set-up-password-protection-for-your-360-virtual-tour-wp-vr/) in case you want to offer private access (maybe for a fee).**


<h4>üîÆ Interactive Virtual Floor Plan for Meaningful Direction (Pro) üîÆ</h4>

One of key highlights of WPVR is it's floor plan feature, popular among realtors and real estate agencies.

https://youtu.be/Nt_idUvBRMk?si=N_otC0xnKwUp9eMy

- If you have a real estate floor plan available, you can add it to the virtual tour. Then you can place pointers on the map and connect them to respective scenes.
- People can look at this map within the tour to know exactly where they are in the property, and click on pointers there to visit that scene directly.

This can play a crucial role in helping visitors get a sense of direction of the property and make a more informed decision.

> Learn more about using [Interactive Virtual Floor Plan](https://rextheme.com/docs/virtual-floor-plans-inside-tours/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=descr&utm_campaign=repo-to-floor-plan-wpvr) in case you want to offer private access (maybe for a fee).


<h4>üîÆ Share Your Virtual Tour On Social Media Via Link Or QR Code (Pro) üîÆ</h4>
With WP VR, you can easily share your 360 degree virtual tours to others or on social media (even without placing it on a web page).

Once you generate a tour, you can either
* copy a shareable link, or
* generate a QR code.

This you can post on any social channel (Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.) or send to your clients via email & direct message.

<h4>üîÆ 360 Video Player for WordPress üîÆ</h4>
Apart from virtual tours using 360 panoramic images, you can use WPVR as a 360 video player on your website.

Meaning, if you have a 360 degree video, you can upload it to your media folder or on YouTube/Vimeo, and then use WPVR to embed it on your website - no custom codes needed.

<h4>üîÆ Cardboard & VR Headset Support for Full Immersive Experience (Pro) üîÆ</h4>

An exciting aspect of WPVR is it's [VR headset support](https://rextheme.com/vr-headset-support/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=descr&utm_campaign=repo-to-vr-headset-wpvr).

You can let people turn on the VR Glass mode in the virtual tour so that visitors can place it on their Google Cartboard or VR headset and take a realistic virtual tour experience!

https://youtu.be/uKtNst1jehs?si=ZiRdsCEY2FQ0ePQN

<h4>üîÆ WPVR Analytics Support (Pro) üîÆ</h4>

Apart from all those interactive options, you also get to view analytics to help you make business decisions.

You will be able to:

- üìà Track Individual Tour Views: Identify which virtual tours got the most attention.
- üî• Analyze Hotspot Interactions: You‚Äôll know which features your clients found most interesting.
- üóìÔ∏è Filter Report Periods: Get reports broken into Weeks, months, years, or even custom dates ‚Äì everything will be crystal clear.

You will be able to understand your customers better, and plan improvements to increase conversions with a data-driven approach.


<h4>üîÆ Mobile First VR Approach üîÆ</h4>
WPVR is designed with a mobile-friendly output in mind. All the tours you make will be fully responsive and weightless for mobile devices.

üëâ Faster Interactive VR Tour Loading on Phone:
Use an auto-resize feature to make virtual tours weightless on mobile devices.

üëâ Better Size For Mobile View
Set up separate heights for mobile devices to offer a comfortable view.

üëâ Notice for Smartphones
You can show custom notices on smartphones to help people with directions.

This makes WPVR an ideal virtual tour creator to match today's business trends.

== Installation ==

1. Upload WPVR to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress
3. Follow the setup wizard to configure the plugin for use


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=1. Why Do I Need WP VR?=

You can easily create a Virtual Tour for free using WP VR to build a virtual presence of your business.

Simply provide a 360 degree panoramic photo and this plugin will create a virtual tour that your visitors can navigate easily.

Allow your prospects to have a realistic tour of your facility before they decide to purchase your service and increase your conversion rate.

=2. How to Install and Activate WP VR?=

Once you have downloaded the file, go to your dashboard. Under Plugins, select Add New, and upload the file. Then Install and activate the plugin.

Once activated, on the left side under your dashboard, you will find the option WP VR at the bottom.

=3. What Kind of Images Should I Use To Create A Virtual Tour?=

To make a perfect equirectangular image, you need to use a 360 degree panoramic photo of the area you want to preview.

However, you can also capture panorama images with your smartphone and use them to create a partial panorama tour.

=5. Can I Customize The Hotspot Icons?=

Yes. You can create a custom class on your theme, stating whatever style you want.

Then you can input the class name on the Hotspot Custom Class section in a hotspot, and the content displayed will be customized according to the style you set.

=6. Can I Create A 360 Degree Video Tour With WPVR?=

Yes, with WP VR, you can create a 360 Degree video tour.

You can either upload the video to create a tour or set a link to a Youtube/Vimeo 360 degree video.

=7. How To Embed A Virtual Tour Using Gutenberg Block Editor?=

Under common blocks, you will find a block called WPVR. Select the block and on the dynamic toolbar on the right, you will get the options to add ID, Height, and Width.

Collect the ID from the virtual tour you created. Assign the height and width as you desire.

=8. The Tour Is Not Loading On The Webpage.=

Go to your WordPress Dashboard > WPVR > Get Started > Settings.

Check the Enable Script Control option status.

If the Enable Script Control option is turned On, turn it off and reload the tour page.

If you wish to use this feature, you have to set the URLs of all the pages on your site with a virtual tour in the List of Allowed Pages To Load WPVR Scripts field.

=9. What To Do If I Get "THE FILE (image link) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED"  Error?=

Sometimes when you add a tour to your site, you might face this issue, rather than loading the tour it will give the error "THE FILE (...) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED."

This error shows up when you are running a website under "HTTPS" (secured with SSL certificate) whereas your image link is under "HTTP" (unsecured).

To solve this issue, go to your WordPress Dashboard > Settings > General.

Here make sure you have "HTTP" added to both "WordPress Address (URL)" and "Site Address (URL)".

And that's it. Your virtual tour should load with no issues.

=10. Can I make The Virtual Tours Full-width?=

Yes, you can publish the tours as the full width of your page/post.

For Gutenberg, Elementor, and Oxygen builder, set fullwidth on the Width field. For shortcodes, set width = "fullwidth".

=11. What If I Use An Optimization or Caching Plugin?=

If you use any Optimization or Caching plugins, then you need to exclude WP VR from its optimization function.

Simply add '/plugins/wpvr' to the exclusion field (or use the location where you store plugins).

=12. Can I Allow The Users of My Site To Create Virtual Tours?=

You can only allow the backend users like Admins, Editors, and Authors of your site to create virtual tours.

Admins & editors will have access to all virtual tours on the site to modify, update and delete them.

Authors can access their own tours only and modify, update, or delete them.

Admins can remove access from Authors and Editors at any time.

= 13. How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wpvr)
