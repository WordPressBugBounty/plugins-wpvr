<h3>🌟 Create A Free Virtual Tour In Just Easy 3 Steps 🌟</h3>

WPVR makes virtual tour creation super easy.

All you need are multiple 360 panorama images to cover different rooms, corners, or spots.

Then, you may follow these **3 simple steps** to create a free 360 VR tour in no time;

1. Upload the images to WPVR and they will turn into 360 panoramic views.
1. Connect them to each other for navigation easily.
1. Place hotspots to provide information around your location.

And you are ready. Now you can publish it and place it on any page on your website.

That’s it, you’ve just created a virtual tour, that too, absolutely free!

Your viewers can move inside or back and forth in this virtual tour, get extra information through hotspots, and get an experience similar to a real-life visit.

*In the free version, you can connect up to 5 scenes, and place up to 5 hotspots on each scene.*

> For unlimited scenes and hotspots, you consider using [WPVR Pro 💎](https://rextheme.com/wpvr/?utm_source=repo-CTA&utm_medium=VR-repo&utm_campaign=VR-repo-to-pricing)

https://youtu.be/kOCNHJdM0TA?si=jdph5JflvX1QmH3S

*You can also add [Scene Transitions (PRO)](https://youtu.be/1VfbztgNFrM?si=e8XfDLDEmrwvYbRn) to make the journey more exciting.*


<h3> Everything You Need To Create Virtual Tours That Engage & Convert </h3>

WPVR is a unique VR tour creator that comes with several exclusive features to make virtual tours more engaging and conversion-optimized.

Simply put, it's not just a tool to show off, but also a solution to **help you get real clients** interested to make inquiries, place bookings, and contact you for negotiations.

<h4>🔮 High Quality Virtual Tours With Multiple Scenes 🔮</h4>

Suppose you want to show off a property with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, living room, balconies, or even a backyard.  Just take 360° panoramic images of each space and let WPVR turn them into one virtual tour.

You’re probably worried about quality - a realistic 360° panorama image needs high resolution, over 3000×1500 pixels.

With WPVR, you can disable WordPress compression and use any high-quality images (JPEG, PNG, WebP) to create free 360° VR tours without losing quality.

<h4>🔮 Use Interactive Hotspots To Answer Questions & Engage With Prospects 🔮</h4>

During a real visit, people want to explore and ask questions - your tour can do the same. 

You can also use interactive hotspots with full control via *[HTML Editor/WYSIWYG Editor](https://rextheme.com/docs/wysiwyg-html-editor-hotspot-content-virtual-tour/)* to add any content you want.

https://youtu.be/rOAX7gqT7HQ?feature=shared

You can enhance your virtual tour with:
➤ Tooltips – Show quick info when visitors hover over an object.
➤ Descriptions – Let people click to see more details. For example, describe the comfort of a hotel bed.
➤ Images or GIFs – Show clearer visuals if something isn’t obvious.
➤ Videos – Use short clips to explain features instead of text.
➤ Audio – Play pre-recorded audio to guide visitors like a real person.

> **Pro Tip:** Pro Tip: Think about questions or highlights visitors might want. Add them as hotspots.

You can also add buttons to link to forms or external pages, like booking or inquiry forms.

*We do have direct support for booking.*

https://youtu.be/ZJkMsq522A4?si=d7dIPGTOj0zINkAb

**Bonus:** You’ll get access to 900+ custom icons to use as hotspots to make the experience meaningufl. And you can add custom colors (Pro) or ripple animation (Pro) to grab user attention.

*P.S. If you want, you can also add custom icons of your own using snippets. ([Hear's how.](https://rextheme.com/docs/how-to-use-the-custom-icon-class/))*

== Installation ==

1. Upload WPVR to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Follow the setup wizard to configure the plugin for use


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=1. Why Do I Need WP VR?=

You can easily create a free virtual tour with WP VR to showcase your business online. 

Just upload a 360° panoramic photo, and the plugin turns it into an easy-to-navigate virtual tour.

This lets visitors explore your space realistically before buying, helping you increase conversions.

=2. How to Install and Activate WP VR?=

Once you have downloaded the file, go to your dashboard. Under Plugins, select Add New, and upload the file. Then Install and activate the plugin.

Once activated, on the left side under your dashboard, you will find the option WP VR at the bottom.

=3. What Kind of Images Should I Use To Create A Virtual Tour?=

To make a perfect equirectangular image, you need to use a 360 degree panoramic photo of the area you want to preview.

However, you can also capture panorama images with your smartphone and use them to create a partial panorama tour.

=5. Can I Customize The Hotspot Icons?=

Yes. You can create a custom class on your theme, stating whatever style you want.

Then you can input the class name on the Hotspot Custom Class section in a hotspot, and the content displayed will be customized according to the style you set.

=6. Can I Create A 360 Degree Video Tour With WPVR?=

Yes, with WP VR, you can create a 360 Degree video tour.

You can either upload the video to create a tour or set a link to a Youtube/Vimeo 360 degree video.

=7. How To Embed A Virtual Tour Using Gutenberg Block Editor?=

Under common blocks, you will find a block called WPVR. Select the block and on the dynamic toolbar on the right, you will get the options to add ID, Height, and Width.

Collect the ID from the virtual tour you created. Assign the height and width as you desire.

=8. The Tour Is Not Loading On The Webpage.=

Go to your WordPress Dashboard > WPVR > Get Started > Settings.

Check the Enable Script Control option status.

If the Enable Script Control option is turned On, turn it off and reload the tour page.

If you wish to use this feature, you have to set the URLs of all the pages on your site with a virtual tour in the List of Allowed Pages To Load WPVR Scripts field.

=9. What To Do If I Get "THE FILE (image link) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED"  Error?=

Sometimes when you add a tour to your site, you might face this issue, rather than loading the tour it will give the error "THE FILE (...) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED."

This error shows up when you are running a website under "HTTPS" (secured with SSL certificate) whereas your image link is under "HTTP" (unsecured).

To solve this issue, go to your WordPress Dashboard > Settings > General.

Here make sure you have "HTTP" added to both "WordPress Address (URL)" and "Site Address (URL)".

And that's it. Your virtual tour should load with no issues.

=10. Can I make The Virtual Tours Full-width?=

Yes, you can publish the tours as the full width of your page/post.

For Gutenberg, Elementor, and Oxygen builder, set fullwidth on the Width field. For shortcodes, set width = "fullwidth".

=11. What If I Use An Optimization or Caching Plugin?=

If you use any Optimization or Caching plugins, then you need to exclude WP VR from its optimization function.

Simply add '/plugins/wpvr' to the exclusion field (or use the location where you store plugins).

=12. Can I Allow The Users of My Site To Create Virtual Tours?=

You can only allow the backend users like Admins, Editors, and Authors of your site to create virtual tours.

Admins & editors will have access to all virtual tours on the site to modify, update and delete them.

Authors can access their own tours only and modify, update, or delete them.

Admins can remove access from Authors and Editors at any time.

= 13. How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security issues through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program.
The Patchstack team will review & handle the issue. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wpvr)
